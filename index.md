# Katelyn Steinman's First CS193 Homework

## Awesome Homework 0 Website

I am so excited to learn CS this year! I think this course is going to be a huge help...I always have felt a little lost in my previous CS classes because of how much they assume you know. However, I have learned that if I am persistant, I can still keep up with those that started further ahead than I did.

Homework 0 is only the beginning of what's sure to be a great year! 

## My **favorite things** about CS 193

- The **TAs/instructors** seem really nice
- The person that wrote the guide for this assignment is **helpful and funny**
- I get to **meet more people** in my major
- Good space to **learn new concepts** I would not have known
- There is **plenty of time to get homework done** in a busy schedule
- The grading system is pretty **student-friendly**

## Evidence I am not glazing you

Since it seems like _every time_ I compliment someone or something, I get accused of glazing them, I will state my case.

1. I changed the theme even though the instructions made it seem like that would offend you
2. I am an honest person--it gets me in trouble sometimes when I say whatever I am thinking
3. I doubt you can find a single sentence on this page that is dishonest, unrealistic, or false
