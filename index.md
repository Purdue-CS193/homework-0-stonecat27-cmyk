# Katelyn Steinman's First CS193 Homework

## Awesome Homework 0 Website

I am so excited to learn CS this year! I think this course is going to be a huge help...I always have felt a little lost in my previous CS classes because of how much they assume you know. However, I have learned that if I am persistant, I can still keep up with those that started further ahead than I did.

Homework 0 is only the beginning of what's sure to be a great year.
